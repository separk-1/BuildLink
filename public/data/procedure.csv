step,description
1_1,Verify that the Feedwater Low Flow Annunciator is illuminated
1_2,Verify that the Feedwater Flow is less than 1000 L/sec
2_1,Turn the Feedwater Control Valve (FWCV) into Manual mode
2_2,Turn the Feedwater Control Valve (FWCV) to 100%
2_3,"Check if the Feedwater Flow has been restored
If the Feedwater Flow has been restored, End procedure
If the Feedwater Flow had not been restored, Go to step 3.1"
3_1,"Check if the Feedwater Pump is OFF
If the Feedwater Pump Switch is OFF, Turn the Feedwater Pump Switch to ON"
3_2,"Check if the Feedwater Flow has been restored
If the Feedwater Flow has been restored, End procedure
If the Feedwater Flow had not been restored, Go to step 4.1"
4_1,Adjust the Turbine Bypass Control Valve to 10%
4_2,Verify the Reactor Core Temperature is decreasing
5_1,Press the Trip Turbine Button
5_2,Verify that the Turbine Speed Control Valve is CLOSED (0.0%)
5_3,Verify that the Turbine Load Control Valve is CLOSED (0.0%)
6_1,Press the Trip Reactor Button
6_2,Verify that the All Rods Down Annunciator is illuminated
6_3,Verify that the Reactor Reactivity is 0.0%
7_1,Press the Activate Safety Injection (SI) Button
7_2,Verify that the Safety Injection Engaged Annunciator is illuminated
8_1,Verify that the Reactor Core Temperature is decreasing
8_2,"Check if the Reactor Core Temperature is below 392 DEG F
If the Reactor Core Temperature is below 392 DEG F, Go to step 9.1
If the Reactor Core Temperature is over 392 DEG F, Go to step 9.2"
9_1,Turn the Power Operated Relief Valve Isolation Valve (PORV IV) to CLOSED
9_2,Turn the Recirculation Coolant Pump Switch to OFF
10_1,"Check if the Reactor Core Temperature is over 250 DEG F
If the Reactor Core Temperature is over 250 DEG F, Slowly adjust the Turbine Bypass Control Valve up to 100%"
10_2,Verify that the Reactor Core Temperature is maintained below 250 DEG F
10_3,Return the Turbine Bypass Control Valve to 0%
